      <h1>Aron Hill</h1>
      <p>Dr Aron Hill is a Senior Research Fellow in the School of Psychology, and co-lead of the Brain Systems and Neurotherapeutics Lab within the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit.</p>
      <p>Aron’s research integrates human electrophysiology, functional neuroimaging, and non-invasive brain stimulation to investigate how the brain communicates and adapts in both health and disease. His work focuses on understanding large-scale functional connectivity and the brain’s capacity to regulate neural activity, known as excitation–inhibition (E-I) balance.</p>
