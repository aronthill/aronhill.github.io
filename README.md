I am a Senior Research Fellow within the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, Deakin University where I co-lead the Brain Systems and Neurotherapeutics Lab. I use a combination of non-invasive human electrophysiology and neurostimulation to better understand brain circuits in health and disease. A key focus of my research is the development of effective evidence-based diagnostic tools and therapeutics for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
